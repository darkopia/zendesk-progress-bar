## Solved Ticket Progress Bar

### Short description

Set weekly ticket goals and track your progress.

### Long description

Progress bar helps you keep track of your ticket goals when answering tickets. Set a goal for solved tickets per week and visualize your progress in the ticket sidebar.

When you reach your ticket goal, a congratulatory message will appear!

### Installation instructions

* Locate the app in the Zendesk Apps Marketplace, click on it and then click on "Install".
* If you would like to have the workweek start on a day other than Monday (which is the default), change this number in the app settings
* "0" for Sunday, "1" for Monday..."6" for Saturday.
* Do not enter a number greater than 6 or less than 0.
* Once installed, open a ticket. The app should appear in the right sidebar with text "Solved Ticket Progress Bar".
* Enter your goal for the week in the text box and click "Submit" or press the enter key.
* Solve tickets! You'll see the bar fill up as you get closer to your goal.

##### Notes:
* Tickets are counted from the morning of the first day (Monday by default) until the evening of the last day of the week (Sunday by default).
* The progress bar and ticket count may not update immediately after solving a ticket; it sometimes takes a couple minutes for Zendesk to update the database that the app uses.
* The bar counts tickets which were marked as "Solved" during the current week and are assigned to the agent using the app. It will not, for example, count solved tickets on which the agent has commented but are assigned to a different agent.
